# ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- MongoDB Atlas account or a local MongoDB instance running.

---

### 1. Backend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create a `.env` file:**

    In the `backend` directory, create a file named `.env` and add your MongoDB connection string and desired port.

    ```env
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string_here
    PORT=3000
    ```

    - Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string_here` with your actual MongoDB Atlas connection string (or local MongoDB URI, e.g., `mongodb://localhost:27017/personalfinancevisualizer`).

4.  **Start the backend server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    # or if using nodemon for development: npm run dev
    ```

    The backend server should start on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port you specified).

### 2. Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create a `.env` file:**

    In the `frontend` directory, create a file named `.env` and specify the URL of your backend API.

    ```env
    VITE_APP_BACKEND_API_URL=your_backend_api_url_here
    ```

    - Replace `your_backend_api_url_here` with the URL where your backend is running. If running locally, this will be `http://localhost:3000`. If you've deployed your backend (e.g., to Render), use its deployed URL.

4.  **Start the frontend development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The frontend application should open in your browser, typically at `http://localhost:5173`.

# üñ•Ô∏è Usage

Once both the backend and frontend servers are running:

- Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173` (or the URL where your frontend is hosted if deployed).

- The application will automatically generate a unique device ID for you (stored in local storage) to keep your data separate. This acts as your "user ID."

- Use the "Add New Transaction" form on the dashboard to record your income and expenses.

- View your transactions in the "Transaction List" and use the "View" button for details, or "Edit" and "Delete" actions.

- Explore your financial overview with the "Expenses Bar Chart" and "Category Breakdown Pie Chart".

- Navigate to the "Budgeting" link in the header to:
  - Set monthly budgets for different expense categories.
  - Review your set budgets in a table.
  - See a "Budget vs Actual Spending" comparison chart for a selected month.
  - Read "Current Month Spending Insights" to understand your financial performance relative to your budgets.
